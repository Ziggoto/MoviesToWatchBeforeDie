#  Movies to Watch Before Die

---

### Why?

I've made this app for a friend of mine who has tons of movie to watch and uses a Google's spreadsheet to manage them. There is a static list of movies as an asset in this application based on that real spreadsheet that I had mentioned. At this moment this movie list is outdated, feel free to change it if you want. I'm making this project public just to be part of my personal portfolio.
